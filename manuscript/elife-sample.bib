@Comment The binding analysis reveals that four Ca2+ ions bind to the EF-hand motifs with relatively high affinity (K1 and K2 = 100 nM, and K3 and K4 = 1.0 μM), and an extra fifth Ca2+ binds to the CaM/CaMBD3 complex in the micromolar range (K5 = 5.0–50.0 μM).
@Comment the binding of CaM to CaMBD2 alone may be sufficient to promote CaM-dependent channel inactivation. (33) Thus, binding of CaM to CaMBD3 is not required for CaM-dependent channel inactivation of RyR2. If CaMBD3 is not important for channel inactivation, then what is the physiological role of the binding of CaM to CaMBD3? Binding of CaM to CaMBD3 might alternatively mediate the Ca2+-dependent association of ryanodine receptors with various accessory proteins that regulate channel function. (33)
@Comment The preferential binding of the CaM N-lobe to RyR (and the CaM C-lobe to the L-type channel) is supported by the observation that the CaM N-lobe binds to CaMBD3 with an affinity (Figure 3A) higher than that with which it binds to the L-type channel, (42) while the CaM C-lobe binds to the L-type channel (42) with an affinity higher than that with which it binds to CaMBD3 (Figure 3B).
@Comment so CaM is a possible physical linker to CaMKII/L-type
@Comment Also, the binding of the fifth Ca2+ causes a 2-fold increase in the binding affinity of the CaM/CaMBD3 complex (Figure 3C), which might be important for fine-tuning the stability of the CaM/RyR2 complex under physiological conditions

@Comment a nice model of RyR2CaM worth sticking to
@Comment their effective concentration relative to a proximate CaM may be very high. Accordingly, these two low-affinity CaMBDs may serve as secondary ‘bridging’ CaM-binding sites under some Ca2+ conditions or in certain RyR conformations, together with a high-affinity tethering site like that of CaMBD2. Noteworthy, Ser-2031 within RyR2 CaMBD1b is a target for phosphorylation by β-adrenergic-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) [46,47] (Figure 1 and Table 1). Our results demonstrated a small decrease in the CaM affinity for the CaMBD1b peptide when using a Ser-2031 phosphorylated, compared with nonphosphorylated CaMBD1b. Hence, PKA-mediated Ser-2031 phosphorylation could potentially affect CaM's inhibition of RyR2, if CaMBD1b is indeed a functionally relevant RyR2 CaMBD at increased [Ca2+].

CaM inhibits RyR2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and aberrant CaM-dependent inhibition results in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. However, the molecular details of the CaM–RyR2 interaction remain unclear. Four CaM-binding domains (CaMBD1a, -1b, -2, and -3) in RyR2 have been proposed. Here, we investigated the Ca2+-dependent interactions between CaM and these CaMBDs by monitoring changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled CaMBD peptides during titration with CaM at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. We showed that CaM bound to all four CaMBDs with affinities that increased with Ca2+ concentration. CaM bound to CaMBD2 and -3 with high affinities across all Ca2+ concentrations tested, but bound to CaMBD1a and -1b only at Ca2+ concentrations above 0.2 µM. Binding experiments using individual CaM domains revealed that the CaM C-domain preferentially bound to CaMBD2, and the N-domain to CaMBD3. Moreover, the Ca2+ affinity of the CaM C-domain in complex with CaMBD2 or -3 was so high that these complexes are essentially Ca2+ saturated under resting Ca2+ conditions. Conversely, the N-domain senses Ca2+ exactly in the transition from resting to activating Ca2+ when complexed to either CaMBD2 or -3. Altogether, our results support a binding model where the CaM C-domain is anchored to RyR2 CaMBD2 and saturated with Ca2+ during Ca2+ oscillations, while the CaM N-domain functions as a dynamic Ca2+ sensor that can bridge noncontiguous regions of RyR2 or clamp down onto CaMBD2.}",

While much of CaM is thought to be protein bound, quantitative data in cardiac myocytes is lacking regarding CaM location, [CaM]free and CaM redistribution during changes in [Ca2+]i. Here, we demonstrated that in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes, CaM is highly concentrated at Z-lines (confirmed by Di-8-ANEPPS staining of transverse tubules) using three different approaches: immunocytochemistry (endogenous CaM), Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate CaM (F-CaM) in both permeabilized cells (exogenous CaM) and in patch clamped intact cells (via pipette dialysis). Using 100nM [CaM]free we washed F-CaM into permeabilized myocytes and saw a two-phase (fast and slow) CaM binding curve with a plateau after 40min of F-CaM wash-in. We also measured myocyte [CaM]free using two modified null-point titration methods, finding [CaM]free to be 50–75nM (which is only 1/100 of total [CaM]). Higher [Ca2+]i increased CaM binding especially in the nucleus and at Z-lines and significantly slowed F-CaM dissociation rate when F-CaM was washed out of permeabilized myocytes. Additionally, in both permeabilized and intact myocytes, CaM moved into the nucleus when [Ca2+]i was elevated, and this was reversible. We conclude that [CaM]free is very low in myocytes even at resting [Ca2+]i, indicating intense competition of CaM targets for free CaM. Bound CaM is relatively concentrated at Z-lines at rest but translocates significantly to the nucleus upon elevation of [Ca2+]i, which may influence activation of different targets and cellular functions.}

    abstract = "{RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine receptor)-mediated Ca2+ release in cardiomyocytes terminates when the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content depletes to a threshold level, known as the termination threshold. Despite its importance, little is known about the mechanism that regulates the termination threshold. CaM (calmodulin), by inhibiting RyR2, has been implicated in Ca2+-release termination, but whether CaM modulates the termination threshold is unknown. To this end, we monitored the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ dynamics in RyR2-expressing HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells transfected with WT (wild-type) CaM or mutants. We found that WT CaM or CaM mutations which abolish Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe (N-terminal lobe) of CaM increased the termination threshold (i.e. facilitated termination), but had no effect on the activation threshold at which spontaneous Ca2+ release occurs. On the other hand, CaM mutations that diminish Ca2+ binding to both the N-lobe and C-lobe (C-terminal lobe), or the C-lobe only, decreased the termination threshold (i.e. delayed termination) with a similar activation threshold. Furthermore, deletion of residues 3583–3603 or point mutations (W3587A/L3591D/F3603A, W3587A, or L3591D) in the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 that are known to abolish or retain CaM binding all reduced the termination threshold without having a significant impact on the activation threshold. Interestingly, the RyR2-F3603A mutation affected both the activation and termination threshold. Collectively, these data indicate that CaM facilitates the termination of Ca2+ release by increasing the termination threshold, and that this action of CaM depends on Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe, but not to the N-lobe, of CaM. The results of the present study also suggest that the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 is an important determinant of Ca2+-release termination and activation.}",

CaM inhibits the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and cardiac muscle receptor (RyR2) at >1 μm Ca2+ but activates RyR1 and inhibits RyR2 at <1 μm Ca2+. Here we tested whether CaM regulates RyR2 by binding to a highly conserved site identified previously in RyR1. Deletion of RyR2 amino acid residues 3583–3603 resulted in background [35S]CaM binding levels. In single channel measurements, deletion of the putative CaM binding site eliminated CaM inhibition of RyR2 at Ca2+ concentrations below and above 1 μm. Five RyR2 single or double mutants in the CaM binding region (W3587A, L3591D, F3603A, W3587A/L3591D, L3591D/F3603A) eliminated or greatly reduced [35S]CaM binding and inhibition of single channel activities by CaM depending on the Ca2+ concentration. An RyR2 mutant, which assessed the effects of 4 amino acid residues that differ between RyR1 and RyR2 in or flanking the CaM binding domain, bound [35S]CaM and was inhibited by CaM, essentially identical to wild type (WT)-RyR2. Three RyR1 mutants (W3620A, L3624D, F3636A) showed responses to CaM that differed from corresponding mutations in RyR2. The results indicate that CaM regulates RyR1 and RyR2 by binding to a single, highly conserved CaM binding site and that other RyR type-specific sites are likely responsible for the differential functional regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM.}

We found that all the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations tested diminished CaM-dependent inhibition of RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release and increased store-overload induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) in HEK293 cells. Moreover, all the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations tested either failed to inhibit or even promoted RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release in permeabilized HEK293 cells with elevated cytosolic Ca2+, which was markedly different from the inhibitory action of CaM wild-type. The CaM mutations also altered the Ca2+-dependency of CaM binding to the RyR2 CaM-binding domain.

abstract = {Background and purpose:  Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+CaM) is widely accepted as an inhibitor of cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2); however, the effects of physiologically relevant CaM concentrations have not been fully investigated. Experimental approach:  We investigated the effects of low concentrations of Ca2+CaM (50–100 nmol·L−1) on the gating of native sheep RyR2, reconstituted into bilayers. Suramin displaces CaM from RyR2 and we have used a gel-shift assay to provide evidence of the mechanism underlying this effect. Finally, using suramin to displace endogenous CaM from RyR2 in permeabilized cardiac cells, we have investigated the effects of 50 nmol·L−1 CaM on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-release. Key results:  Ca2+CaM activated or inhibited single RyR2, but activation was much more likely at low (50–100 nmol·L−1) concentrations. Also, suramin displaced CaM from a peptide of the CaM binding domain of RyR2, indicating that, like the skeletal isoform (RyR1), suramin directly competes with CaM for its binding site on the channel. Pre-treatment of rat permeabilized ventricular myocytes with suramin to displace CaM, followed by addition of 50 nmol·L−1 CaM to the mock cytoplasmic solution caused an increase in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+-release events. Application of caffeine demonstrated that 50 nmol·L−1 CaM reduced SR Ca2+ content. Conclusions and implications:  We describe for the first time how Ca2+CaM is capable, not only of inactivating, but also of activating RyR2 channels in bilayers in a CaM kinase II-independent manner. Similarly, in cardiac cells, CaM stimulates SR Ca2+-release and the use of caffeine suggests that this is a RyR2-mediated effect.},

In contrast, it is well known that Ca2+CaM inhibits [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since the [3H]ryanodine binding technique does not reflect the effects of Ca2+CaM on RyR2 open probability (Po), we have investigated, using the reversible ryanoid, ryanodol, whether Ca2+CaM can directly influence the binding of ryanoids to single RyR2 channels independently of Po. We demonstrate that Ca2+CaM reduces the rate of ryanodol association to RyR2 without affecting the rate of dissociation. We also find that ryanodol-bound channels fluctuate between at least two distinct subconductance states, M1 and M2, in a voltage-dependent manner. Ca2+CaM significantly alters the equilibrium between these two states. The results suggest that Ca2+CaM binding to RyR2 causes a conformation change to regions of the channel that include the ryanoid binding site, thereby leading to a decrease in ryanoid association rate and modulation of gating within the ryanoid/RyR2 bound state. Our data provide a possible explanation for why the effects of Ca2+CaM at the single-channel level are not mirrored by [3H]ryanodine binding studies.}

ABSTRACT = {Cardiac arrhythmias are serious, life-threatening diseases associated with the dysregulation of Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. This dysregulation often arises from dysfunction of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), the principal Ca2+ release channel. Dysfunction of RyR1, the skeletal muscle isoform, also results in less severe, but also potentially life-threatening syndromes. The RYR2 and RYR1 genes have been found to harbor three main mutation “hot spots”, where mutations change the channel structure, its interdomain interface properties, its interactions with its binding partners, or its dynamics. In all cases, the result is a defective release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the myocyte cytoplasm. Here, we provide an overview of the most frequent diseases resulting from mutations to RyR1 and RyR2, briefly review some of the recent experimental structural work on these two molecules, detail some of the computational work describing their dynamics, and summarize the known changes to the structure and function of these receptors with particular emphasis on their N-terminal, central, and channel domains.},

    abstract = "{Cytosolic calcium concentration in resting cardiac myocytes locally fluctuates as a result of spontaneous microscopic Ca2+ releases or abruptly rises as a result of an external trigger. These processes, observed as calcium sparks, are fundamental for proper function of cardiac muscle. In this study, we analyze how the characteristics of spontaneous and triggered calcium sparks are related to cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR) gating. We show that the frequency of spontaneous sparks and the probability distribution of calcium release flux quanta of triggered sparks correspond quantitatively to predictions of an allosteric homotetrameric model of RYR gating. This model includes competitive binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions to the RYR activation sites and allosteric interaction between divalent ion binding and channel opening. It turns out that at rest, RYRs are almost fully occupied by Mg2+. Therefore, spontaneous sparks are most frequently evoked by random openings of the highly populated but rarely opening Mg4RYR and CaMg3RYR forms, whereas triggered sparks are most frequently evoked by random openings of the less populated but much more readily opening Ca2Mg2RYR and Ca3MgRYR forms. In both the spontaneous and the triggered sparks, only a small fraction of RYRs in the calcium release unit manages to open during the spark because of the limited rate of Mg2+ unbinding. This mechanism clarifies the unexpectedly low calcium release flux during elementary release events and unifies the theory of calcium signaling in resting and contracting cardiac myocytes.}",

    abstract = { Previous studies in transgenic mice and with isolated ryanodine receptors (RyR) have indicated that Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can phosphorylate RyR and activate local diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks) and RyR channel opening. Here we use relatively controlled physiological conditions in saponin-permeabilized wild type (WT) and phospholamban knockout (PLB-KO) mouse ventricular myocytes to test whether exogenous preactivated CaMKII or endogenous CaMKII can enhance resting Ca2+ sparks. PLB-KO mice were used to preclude ancillary effects of CaMKII mediated by phospholamban phosphorylation. In both WT and PLB-KO myocytes, Ca2+ spark frequency was increased by both preactivated exogenous CaMKII and endogenous CaMKII. This effect was abolished by CaMKII inhibitor peptides. In contrast, protein kinase A catalytic subunit also enhanced Ca2+ spark frequency in WT, but had no effect in PLB-KO. Both endogenous and exogenous CaMKII increased SR Ca2+ content in WT (presumably via PLB phosphorylation), but not in PLB-KO. Exogenous calmodulin decreased Ca2+ spark frequency in both WT and PLB-KO (K0.5 ≈100 nmol/L). Endogenous CaMKII (at 500 nmol/L [Ca2+]) phosphorylated RyR as completely in \&lt;4 minutes as the maximum achieved by preactivated exogenous CaMKII. After CaMKII activation Ca2+ sparks were longer in duration, and more frequent propagating SR Ca2+ release events were observed. We conclude that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR by endogenous associated CaMKII (but not PKA-dependent phosphorylation) increases resting SR Ca2+ release or leak. Moreover, this may explain the enhanced SR diastolic Ca2+ leak and certain triggered arrhythmias seen in heart failure. }

    abstract = { Ion channels play a central role in the regulation of nearly every cellular process. Dating back to the classic 1952 Hodgkin–Huxley model of the generation of the action potential, ion channels have always been thought of as independent agents. A myriad of recent experimental findings exploiting advances in electrophysiology, structural biology, and imaging techniques, however, have posed a serious challenge to this long-held axiom, as several classes of ion channels appear to open and close in a coordinated, cooperative manner. Ion channel cooperativity ranges from variable-sized oligomeric cooperative gating in voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels to obligatory dimeric assembly and gating of voltage-gated NaV1.5 channels. Potassium channels, transient receptor potential channels, hyperpolarization cyclic nucleotide-activated channels, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) have also been shown to gate cooperatively. The implications of cooperative gating of these ion channels range from fine-tuning excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells to regulating cardiac function and vascular tone, to modulation of action potential and conduction velocity in neurons and cardiac cells, and to control of pacemaking activity in the heart. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms leading to cooperative gating of ion channels, their physiological consequences, and how alterations in cooperative gating of ion channels may induce a range of clinically significant pathologies. }

abstract = {Persistent inflammation results in an increase in the magnitude and duration of high K+-evoked Ca2+ transients in putative nociceptive cutaneous dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether recruitment of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) contributes to these inflammation-induced changes. Acutely dissociated, retrogradely labeled cutaneous DRG neurons from naïve and complete Freund's adjuvant inflamed adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were studied with ratiometric microfluorimetry. Ryanodine only attenuated the duration but not magnitude of the high K+-evoked Ca2+ transient in neurons from inflamed rats. However, there was no significant impact of inflammation on the potency or efficacy of ryanodine-induced block of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient, or the impact of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) inhibition on the high K+-evoked Ca2+ transient. Furthermore, while there was no change in the magnitude, an inflammation-induced increase in the duration of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient was only observed with a prolonged caffeine application. In contrast to the high K+-evoked Ca2+ transient, there was no evidence of direct mitochondrial involvement or that of the Ca2+ extrusion mechanism, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, on the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient, and block of SERCA only increased the duration of this transient. These results indicate the presence of Ca2+ regulatory domains in cutaneous nociceptive DRG neurons within which cytosolic Ca2+ increased via influx and release are highly segregated. Furthermore, our results suggest that changes in neither CICR machinery nor the coupling between Ca2+ influx and CICR are primarily responsible for the inflammation-induced changes in the evoked Ca2+ transient.}

CPVT results from stress-induced sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ leak via the mutant RyR2 channels during diastole. We present atomic models of human wild-type (WT) RyR2 and the CPVT mutant RyR2-R2474S determined by cryo–electron microscopy with overall resolutions in the range of 2.6 to 3.6 Å, and reaching local resolutions of 2.25 Å, unprecedented for RyR2 channels. Under nonactivating conditions, the RyR2-R2474S channel is in a “primed” state between the closed and open states of WT RyR2, rendering it more sensitive to activation that results in stress-induced Ca2+ leak. The Rycal drug ARM210 binds to RyR2-R2474S, reverting the primed state toward the closed state. Together, these studies provide a mechanism for CPVT and for the therapeutic actions of ARM210. Cryo-EM structures of human RyR2, pathological primed RyR2-R2474S, and RyR2-R2474S reveal a mechanism for Rycal ARM210 treatment.}}


@article{10.1242/jcs.133454,
@Comment In this study, we demonstrated by cryo-EM that two hypothesized CaM-binding sequences in RyR2, 3581–3612 and 4261–4286 (corresponding to 3614–3643 and 4302–4328 in RyR1) are both in close proximity to the previously found locations of CaM. In addition, we found that when the RyR2 channel is activated, the structural domains bearing these two sequences move apart, indicating that conformational changes associated with channel activation occur in the vicinity of receptor-bound CaM. We suggest that these conformational changes also affect CaM binding, and vice versa, which would be consistent with the known influences CaM on channel gating. Clearly, more detailed studies of conformational changes in this region of RyR are needed. RyR activation is induced either by direct interaction with DHPR (for RyR1), by a small amount of Ca2+ influx from DHPR (for RyR2) or by Ca2+ released from SR stores through nearby RyRs (RyR1 and RyR2). Global conformational changes underlie RyR activation, including changes in the clamp region (Tian et al., 2013), in the transmembrane region that result in ion channel activation (Samsó et al., 2009), Global conformational changes underlie RyR activation, including changes in the clamp region (Tian et al., 2013), in the transmembrane region that result in ion channel activation (Samsó et al., 2009), and, as we show here for the first time, in the CaM-binding region of RyR1. Upon RyR activation the two fluorophore-labeled sequences move apart, a structural change that is likely to be influenced by CaM. We hypothesize that for RyR2, the presence of either apo-CaM or Ca2+-CaM inhibits the conformational change, whereas for RyR1 apo-CaM facilitates and Ca2+-CaM inhibits it, thereby accounting for the regulatory effects of CaM on the activity of RyR2 and RyR1. Additional biophysical characterization, by FRET and other techniques, of this conformational change on both RyR2 and RyR1 and in the presence of CaM and calcium should allow us to refine or reject this hypothesis. It is also possible that the conformational change we have discovered plays a role in the termination of Ca2+ release, particularly for RyR2 for which the mechanism by which Ca2+ release is terminated during excitation–contraction coupling in the heart is not understood (Cannell and Kong, 2012; Stern and Cheng, 2004).

    abstract = "{Calmodulin (CaM), a 16 kDa ubiquitous calcium-sensing protein, is known to bind tightly to the calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR), and modulate RyR function. CaM binding studies using RyR fragments or synthetic peptides have revealed the presence of multiple, potential CaM-binding regions in the primary sequence of RyR. In the present study, we inserted GFP into two of these proposed CaM-binding sequences and mapped them onto the three-dimensional structure of intact cardiac RyR2 by cryo-electron microscopy. Interestingly, we found that the two potential CaM-binding regions encompassing, Arg3595 and Lys4269, respectively, are in close proximity and are adjacent to the previously mapped CaM-binding sites. To monitor the conformational dynamics of these CaM-binding regions, we generated a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, a dual CFP- and YFP-labeled RyR2 (RyR2R3595-CFP/K4269-YFP) with CFP inserted after Arg3595 and YFP inserted after Lys4269. We transfected HEK293 cells with the RyR2R3595-CFP/K4269-YFP cDNA, and examined their FRET signal in live cells. We detected significant FRET signals in transfected cells that are sensitive to the channel activator caffeine, suggesting that caffeine is able to induce conformational changes in these CaM-binding regions. Importantly, no significant FRET signals were detected in cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding the single CFP (RyR2R3595-CFP) and single YFP (RyR2K4269-YFP) insertions, indicating that the FRET signal stemmed from the interaction between R3595–CFP and K4269–YFP that are in the same RyR subunit. These observations suggest that multiple regions in the RyR2 sequence may contribute to an intra-subunit CaM-binding pocket that undergoes conformational changes during channel gating.}",

    abstract = { Hyperphosphorylation of the cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR2) by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine-2808 has been proposed to be a key mechanism responsible for cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (HF). However, the sites of PKA phosphorylation in RyR2 and their phosphorylation status in HF are not well defined. Here we used various approaches to investigate the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA. Mutating serine-2808, which was thought to be the only PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2, did not abolish the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping revealed two major PKA phosphopeptides, one of which corresponded to the known serine-2808 site. Another, novel, PKA phosphorylation site, serine 2030, was identified by Edman sequencing. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that the novel serine-2030 site was phosphorylated in rat cardiac myocytes stimulated with isoproterenol, but not in unstimulated cells, whereas serine-2808 was considerably phosphorylated before and after isoproterenol treatment. We further showed that serine-2030 was stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKA, but not by CaMKII, and that mutations of serine-2030 altered neither the FKBP12.6-RyR2 interaction nor the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. Moreover, the levels of phosphorylation of RyR2 at serine-2030 and serine-2808 in both failing and non-failing canine hearts were similar. Together, our data indicate that serine-2030 is a major PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2 responding to acute β-adrenergic stimulation, and that RyR2 is not hyperphosphorylated by PKA in canine HF. }
