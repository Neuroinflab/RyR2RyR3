abstract = {Metabolically 35S-labeled calmodulin (CaM) was used to determine the CaM binding properties of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and to identify potential channel domains for CaM binding. In addition, regulation of RyR2 by CaM was assessed in [3H]ryanodine binding and single-channel measurements. Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles bound approximately four CaM molecules per RyR2 tetramer in the absence of Ca2+; in the presence of 100 μmCa2+, the vesicles bound 7.5 CaM molecules per tetramer. Purified RyR2 bound approximately four [35S]CaM molecules per RyR tetramer, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. At least four CaM binding domains were identified in [35S]CaM overlays of fusion proteins spanning the full-length RyR2. The affinity (but not the stoichiometry) of CaM binding was altered by redox state as controlled by the presence of either GSH or GSSG. Inhibition of RyR2 activity by CaM was influenced by Ca2+ concentration, redox state, and other channel modulators. Parallel experiments with the skeletal muscle isoform showed major differences in the CaM binding properties and regulation by CaM of the skeletal and cardiac ryanodine receptors.}

CaM inhibits RyR2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and aberrant CaM-dependent inhibition results in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. However, the molecular details of the CaM–RyR2 interaction remain unclear. Four CaM-binding domains (CaMBD1a, -1b, -2, and -3) in RyR2 have been proposed. Here, we investigated the Ca2+-dependent interactions between CaM and these CaMBDs by monitoring changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled CaMBD peptides during titration with CaM at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. We showed that CaM bound to all four CaMBDs with affinities that increased with Ca2+ concentration. CaM bound to CaMBD2 and -3 with high affinities across all Ca2+ concentrations tested, but bound to CaMBD1a and -1b only at Ca2+ concentrations above 0.2 µM. Binding experiments using individual CaM domains revealed that the CaM C-domain preferentially bound to CaMBD2, and the N-domain to CaMBD3. Moreover, the Ca2+ affinity of the CaM C-domain in complex with CaMBD2 or -3 was so high that these complexes are essentially Ca2+ saturated under resting Ca2+ conditions. Conversely, the N-domain senses Ca2+ exactly in the transition from resting to activating Ca2+ when complexed to either CaMBD2 or -3. Altogether, our results support a binding model where the CaM C-domain is anchored to RyR2 CaMBD2 and saturated with Ca2+ during Ca2+ oscillations, while the CaM N-domain functions as a dynamic Ca2+ sensor that can bridge noncontiguous regions of RyR2 or clamp down onto CaMBD2.}",

While much of CaM is thought to be protein bound, quantitative data in cardiac myocytes is lacking regarding CaM location, [CaM]free and CaM redistribution during changes in [Ca2+]i. Here, we demonstrated that in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes, CaM is highly concentrated at Z-lines (confirmed by Di-8-ANEPPS staining of transverse tubules) using three different approaches: immunocytochemistry (endogenous CaM), Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate CaM (F-CaM) in both permeabilized cells (exogenous CaM) and in patch clamped intact cells (via pipette dialysis). Using 100nM [CaM]free we washed F-CaM into permeabilized myocytes and saw a two-phase (fast and slow) CaM binding curve with a plateau after 40min of F-CaM wash-in. We also measured myocyte [CaM]free using two modified null-point titration methods, finding [CaM]free to be 50–75nM (which is only 1/100 of total [CaM]). Higher [Ca2+]i increased CaM binding especially in the nucleus and at Z-lines and significantly slowed F-CaM dissociation rate when F-CaM was washed out of permeabilized myocytes. Additionally, in both permeabilized and intact myocytes, CaM moved into the nucleus when [Ca2+]i was elevated, and this was reversible. We conclude that [CaM]free is very low in myocytes even at resting [Ca2+]i, indicating intense competition of CaM targets for free CaM. Bound CaM is relatively concentrated at Z-lines at rest but translocates significantly to the nucleus upon elevation of [Ca2+]i, which may influence activation of different targets and cellular functions.}

    abstract = "{RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine receptor)-mediated Ca2+ release in cardiomyocytes terminates when the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content depletes to a threshold level, known as the termination threshold. Despite its importance, little is known about the mechanism that regulates the termination threshold. CaM (calmodulin), by inhibiting RyR2, has been implicated in Ca2+-release termination, but whether CaM modulates the termination threshold is unknown. To this end, we monitored the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ dynamics in RyR2-expressing HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells transfected with WT (wild-type) CaM or mutants. We found that WT CaM or CaM mutations which abolish Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe (N-terminal lobe) of CaM increased the termination threshold (i.e. facilitated termination), but had no effect on the activation threshold at which spontaneous Ca2+ release occurs. On the other hand, CaM mutations that diminish Ca2+ binding to both the N-lobe and C-lobe (C-terminal lobe), or the C-lobe only, decreased the termination threshold (i.e. delayed termination) with a similar activation threshold. Furthermore, deletion of residues 3583–3603 or point mutations (W3587A/L3591D/F3603A, W3587A, or L3591D) in the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 that are known to abolish or retain CaM binding all reduced the termination threshold without having a significant impact on the activation threshold. Interestingly, the RyR2-F3603A mutation affected both the activation and termination threshold. Collectively, these data indicate that CaM facilitates the termination of Ca2+ release by increasing the termination threshold, and that this action of CaM depends on Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe, but not to the N-lobe, of CaM. The results of the present study also suggest that the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 is an important determinant of Ca2+-release termination and activation.}",

CaM inhibits the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and cardiac muscle receptor (RyR2) at >1 μm Ca2+ but activates RyR1 and inhibits RyR2 at <1 μm Ca2+. Here we tested whether CaM regulates RyR2 by binding to a highly conserved site identified previously in RyR1. Deletion of RyR2 amino acid residues 3583–3603 resulted in background [35S]CaM binding levels. In single channel measurements, deletion of the putative CaM binding site eliminated CaM inhibition of RyR2 at Ca2+ concentrations below and above 1 μm. Five RyR2 single or double mutants in the CaM binding region (W3587A, L3591D, F3603A, W3587A/L3591D, L3591D/F3603A) eliminated or greatly reduced [35S]CaM binding and inhibition of single channel activities by CaM depending on the Ca2+ concentration. An RyR2 mutant, which assessed the effects of 4 amino acid residues that differ between RyR1 and RyR2 in or flanking the CaM binding domain, bound [35S]CaM and was inhibited by CaM, essentially identical to wild type (WT)-RyR2. Three RyR1 mutants (W3620A, L3624D, F3636A) showed responses to CaM that differed from corresponding mutations in RyR2. The results indicate that CaM regulates RyR1 and RyR2 by binding to a single, highly conserved CaM binding site and that other RyR type-specific sites are likely responsible for the differential functional regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM.}

While some of the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations have been shown to impair CaM-dependent inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release through the ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2), the impact of a majority of these mutations on RyR2 function is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of 14 arrhythmogenic CaM mutations on the CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition. We found that all the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations tested diminished CaM-dependent inhibition of RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release and increased store-overload induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) in HEK293 cells. Moreover, all the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations tested either failed to inhibit or even promoted RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release in permeabilized HEK293 cells with elevated cytosolic Ca2+, which was markedly different from the inhibitory action of CaM wild-type. The CaM mutations also altered the Ca2+-dependency of CaM binding to the RyR2 CaM-binding domain. These results demonstrate that diminished inhibition, and even facilitated activation, of RyR2–mediated Ca2+ release is a common defect of arrhythmogenic CaM mutations.},

ABSTRACT = {Cardiac arrhythmias are serious, life-threatening diseases associated with the dysregulation of Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. This dysregulation often arises from dysfunction of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), the principal Ca2+ release channel. Dysfunction of RyR1, the skeletal muscle isoform, also results in less severe, but also potentially life-threatening syndromes. The RYR2 and RYR1 genes have been found to harbor three main mutation “hot spots”, where mutations change the channel structure, its interdomain interface properties, its interactions with its binding partners, or its dynamics. In all cases, the result is a defective release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the myocyte cytoplasm. Here, we provide an overview of the most frequent diseases resulting from mutations to RyR1 and RyR2, briefly review some of the recent experimental structural work on these two molecules, detail some of the computational work describing their dynamics, and summarize the known changes to the structure and function of these receptors with particular emphasis on their N-terminal, central, and channel domains.},

    abstract = "{Cytosolic calcium concentration in resting cardiac myocytes locally fluctuates as a result of spontaneous microscopic Ca2+ releases or abruptly rises as a result of an external trigger. These processes, observed as calcium sparks, are fundamental for proper function of cardiac muscle. In this study, we analyze how the characteristics of spontaneous and triggered calcium sparks are related to cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR) gating. We show that the frequency of spontaneous sparks and the probability distribution of calcium release flux quanta of triggered sparks correspond quantitatively to predictions of an allosteric homotetrameric model of RYR gating. This model includes competitive binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions to the RYR activation sites and allosteric interaction between divalent ion binding and channel opening. It turns out that at rest, RYRs are almost fully occupied by Mg2+. Therefore, spontaneous sparks are most frequently evoked by random openings of the highly populated but rarely opening Mg4RYR and CaMg3RYR forms, whereas triggered sparks are most frequently evoked by random openings of the less populated but much more readily opening Ca2Mg2RYR and Ca3MgRYR forms. In both the spontaneous and the triggered sparks, only a small fraction of RYRs in the calcium release unit manages to open during the spark because of the limited rate of Mg2+ unbinding. This mechanism clarifies the unexpectedly low calcium release flux during elementary release events and unifies the theory of calcium signaling in resting and contracting cardiac myocytes.}",

    abstract = { Previous studies in transgenic mice and with isolated ryanodine receptors (RyR) have indicated that Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can phosphorylate RyR and activate local diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks) and RyR channel opening. Here we use relatively controlled physiological conditions in saponin-permeabilized wild type (WT) and phospholamban knockout (PLB-KO) mouse ventricular myocytes to test whether exogenous preactivated CaMKII or endogenous CaMKII can enhance resting Ca2+ sparks. PLB-KO mice were used to preclude ancillary effects of CaMKII mediated by phospholamban phosphorylation. In both WT and PLB-KO myocytes, Ca2+ spark frequency was increased by both preactivated exogenous CaMKII and endogenous CaMKII. This effect was abolished by CaMKII inhibitor peptides. In contrast, protein kinase A catalytic subunit also enhanced Ca2+ spark frequency in WT, but had no effect in PLB-KO. Both endogenous and exogenous CaMKII increased SR Ca2+ content in WT (presumably via PLB phosphorylation), but not in PLB-KO. Exogenous calmodulin decreased Ca2+ spark frequency in both WT and PLB-KO (K0.5 ≈100 nmol/L). Endogenous CaMKII (at 500 nmol/L [Ca2+]) phosphorylated RyR as completely in \&lt;4 minutes as the maximum achieved by preactivated exogenous CaMKII. After CaMKII activation Ca2+ sparks were longer in duration, and more frequent propagating SR Ca2+ release events were observed. We conclude that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR by endogenous associated CaMKII (but not PKA-dependent phosphorylation) increases resting SR Ca2+ release or leak. Moreover, this may explain the enhanced SR diastolic Ca2+ leak and certain triggered arrhythmias seen in heart failure. }

    abstract = { Ion channels play a central role in the regulation of nearly every cellular process. Dating back to the classic 1952 Hodgkin–Huxley model of the generation of the action potential, ion channels have always been thought of as independent agents. A myriad of recent experimental findings exploiting advances in electrophysiology, structural biology, and imaging techniques, however, have posed a serious challenge to this long-held axiom, as several classes of ion channels appear to open and close in a coordinated, cooperative manner. Ion channel cooperativity ranges from variable-sized oligomeric cooperative gating in voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels to obligatory dimeric assembly and gating of voltage-gated NaV1.5 channels. Potassium channels, transient receptor potential channels, hyperpolarization cyclic nucleotide-activated channels, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) have also been shown to gate cooperatively. The implications of cooperative gating of these ion channels range from fine-tuning excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells to regulating cardiac function and vascular tone, to modulation of action potential and conduction velocity in neurons and cardiac cells, and to control of pacemaking activity in the heart. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms leading to cooperative gating of ion channels, their physiological consequences, and how alterations in cooperative gating of ion channels may induce a range of clinically significant pathologies. }

abstract = {Ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) mutations have been linked to an inherited form of exercise-induced sudden cardiac death called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT results from stress-induced sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ leak via the mutant RyR2 channels during diastole. We present atomic models of human wild-type (WT) RyR2 and the CPVT mutant RyR2-R2474S determined by cryo–electron microscopy with overall resolutions in the range of 2.6 to 3.6 Å, and reaching local resolutions of 2.25 Å, unprecedented for RyR2 channels. Under nonactivating conditions, the RyR2-R2474S channel is in a “primed” state between the closed and open states of WT RyR2, rendering it more sensitive to activation that results in stress-induced Ca2+ leak. The Rycal drug ARM210 binds to RyR2-R2474S, reverting the primed state toward the closed state. Together, these studies provide a mechanism for CPVT and for the therapeutic actions of ARM210. Cryo-EM structures of human RyR2, pathological primed RyR2-R2474S, and RyR2-R2474S reveal a mechanism for Rycal ARM210 treatment.}}

    abstract = "{Calmodulin (CaM), a 16 kDa ubiquitous calcium-sensing protein, is known to bind tightly to the calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR), and modulate RyR function. CaM binding studies using RyR fragments or synthetic peptides have revealed the presence of multiple, potential CaM-binding regions in the primary sequence of RyR. In the present study, we inserted GFP into two of these proposed CaM-binding sequences and mapped them onto the three-dimensional structure of intact cardiac RyR2 by cryo-electron microscopy. Interestingly, we found that the two potential CaM-binding regions encompassing, Arg3595 and Lys4269, respectively, are in close proximity and are adjacent to the previously mapped CaM-binding sites. To monitor the conformational dynamics of these CaM-binding regions, we generated a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, a dual CFP- and YFP-labeled RyR2 (RyR2R3595-CFP/K4269-YFP) with CFP inserted after Arg3595 and YFP inserted after Lys4269. We transfected HEK293 cells with the RyR2R3595-CFP/K4269-YFP cDNA, and examined their FRET signal in live cells. We detected significant FRET signals in transfected cells that are sensitive to the channel activator caffeine, suggesting that caffeine is able to induce conformational changes in these CaM-binding regions. Importantly, no significant FRET signals were detected in cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding the single CFP (RyR2R3595-CFP) and single YFP (RyR2K4269-YFP) insertions, indicating that the FRET signal stemmed from the interaction between R3595–CFP and K4269–YFP that are in the same RyR subunit. These observations suggest that multiple regions in the RyR2 sequence may contribute to an intra-subunit CaM-binding pocket that undergoes conformational changes during channel gating.}",

    abstract = { Hyperphosphorylation of the cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR2) by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine-2808 has been proposed to be a key mechanism responsible for cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (HF). However, the sites of PKA phosphorylation in RyR2 and their phosphorylation status in HF are not well defined. Here we used various approaches to investigate the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA. Mutating serine-2808, which was thought to be the only PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2, did not abolish the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping revealed two major PKA phosphopeptides, one of which corresponded to the known serine-2808 site. Another, novel, PKA phosphorylation site, serine 2030, was identified by Edman sequencing. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that the novel serine-2030 site was phosphorylated in rat cardiac myocytes stimulated with isoproterenol, but not in unstimulated cells, whereas serine-2808 was considerably phosphorylated before and after isoproterenol treatment. We further showed that serine-2030 was stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKA, but not by CaMKII, and that mutations of serine-2030 altered neither the FKBP12.6-RyR2 interaction nor the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. Moreover, the levels of phosphorylation of RyR2 at serine-2030 and serine-2808 in both failing and non-failing canine hearts were similar. Together, our data indicate that serine-2030 is a major PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2 responding to acute β-adrenergic stimulation, and that RyR2 is not hyperphosphorylated by PKA in canine HF. }

abstract = {Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are Ca2+ release channels, gated by Ca2+ in the cytosol and the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen. Their regulation is impaired in certain cardiac and muscle diseases. Although a lot of data is available on the luminal Ca2+ regulation of RyR, its interpretation is complicated by the possibility that the divalent ions used to probe the luminal binding sites may contaminate the cytoplasmic sites by crossing the channel pore. In this study, we used Eu3+, an impermeable agonist of Ca2+ binding sites, as a probe to avoid this complication and to gain more specific information about the function of the luminal Ca2+ sensor. Single-channel currents were measured from skeletal muscle and cardiac RyRs (RyR1 and RyR2) using the lipid bilayer technique. We show that RyR2 is activated by the luminal addition of Ca2+, whereas RyR1 is inhibited. These results were qualitatively reproducible using Eu3+. The luminal regulation of RyR1 carrying a mutation associated with malignant hyperthermia was not different from that of the wild-type. RyR1 inhibition by Eu3+ was extremely voltage dependent, whereas RyR2 activation did not depend on the membrane potential. These results suggest that the RyR1 inhibition site is in the membrane’s electric field (channel pore), whereas the RyR2 activation site is outside. Using in silico analysis and previous results, we predicted putative Ca2+ binding site sequences. We propose that RyR2 bears an activation site, which is missing in RyR1, but both isoforms share the same inhibitory Ca2+ binding site near the channel gate.}

abstract = {The Ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) inhibits cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)-mediated Ca2+ release. CaM mutations associated with arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death have been shown to diminish CaM-dependent inhibition of RyR2, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Nearly all arrhythmogenic CaM mutations identified are located in the C-domain of CaM and exert marked effects on Ca2+ binding to CaM and on the CaM C-domain interaction with the CaM-binding domain 2 (CaMBD2) in RyR2. Interestingly, the arrhythmogenic N-domain mutation CaM-N54I has little or no effect on Ca2+ binding to CaM or the CaM C-domain-RyR2 CaMBD2 interaction, unlike all CaM C-domain mutations. This suggests that CaM-N54I may diminish CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition by affecting CaM N-domain interactions with RyR2 CaMBDs other than CaMBD2. To explore this possibility, we assessed the effects of deleting each of the four known CaMBDs in RyR2 (CaMBD1a, -1b, -2, or -3) on the CaM-dependent inhibition of RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. We found that removing CaMBD1a, CaMBD1b, or CaMBD3 did not alter the effects of CaM-N54I or CaM-WT on RyR2 inhibition. On the other hand, deleting RyR2-CaMBD2 abolished the effects of both CaM-N54I and CaM-WT. Our results support that CaM-N54I causes aberrant RyR2 regulation via an uncharacterized CaMBD or less likely CaMBD2, and that RyR2 CaMBD2 is required for the actions of both N- and C-domain CaM mutations. Moreover, our results show that CaMBD1a is central to RyR2 regulation, but CaMBD1a, CaMBD1b, and CaMBD3 are not required for CaM-dependent inhibition of RyR2 in HEK293 cells.},

In cardiac muscle, the major binding partner of CaM is the type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and altered CaM binding contributes to defects in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium (Ca2+) release. Many genetic studies have reported a series of CaM missense mutations in patients with a history of severe arrhythmogenic cardiac disorders. In the present study, we generated four missense CaM mutants (CaMN98I, CaMD132E, CaMD134H and CaMQ136P) and we used a CaM-RyR2 co-immunoprecipitation and a [3H]ryanodine binding assay to directly compare the relative RyR2-binding of wild type and mutant CaM proteins and to investigate the functional effects of these CaM mutations on RyR2 activity. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed to investigate and compare the interactions of the wild-type and mutant CaM proteins with various synthetic peptides located in the well-established RyR2 CaM-binding region (3584-3602aa), as well as another CaM-binding region (4255-4271aa) of human RyR2. Our data revealed that all four CaM mutants displayed dramatically reduced RyR2 interaction and defective modulation of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2, regardless of LQTS or CPVT association. Moreover, our isothermal titration calorimetry ITC data suggest that RyR2 3584-3602aa and 4255-4271aa regions interact with significant affinity with wild-type CaM, in the presence and absence of Ca2+, two regions that might contribute to a putative intra-subunit CaM-binding pocket. In contrast, screening the interaction of the four arrhythmogenic CaM mutants with two synthetic peptides that correspond to these RyR2 regions, revealed disparate binding properties and signifying differential mechanisms that contribute to reduced RyR2 association.}

One unverified premise of this hypothesis is that the RyR must be fast enough to track the brief (\\&lt;0.5 ms) Ca2+ elevations accompanying single DHPR channel openings. To define the kinetic limits of effective trigger Ca2+ signals, we recorded activity of single cardiac RyRs in lipid bilayers during rapid and transient increases in Ca2+ generated by flash photolysis of DM-nitrophen. Application of such Ca2+ spikes (amplitude ∼10–30 μM, duration ∼0.1–0.4 ms) resulted in activation of the RyRs with a probability that increased steeply (apparent Hill slope ∼2.5) with spike amplitude. The time constants of RyR activation were 0.07–0.27 ms, decreasing with spike amplitude. To fit the rising portion of the open probability, a single exponential function had to be raised to a power n ∼ 3. We show that these data could be adequately described with a gating scheme incorporating four sequential Ca2+-sensitive closed states between the resting and the first open states. These results provide evidence that brief Ca2+ triggers are adequate to activate the RyR, and support the possibility that RyR channels are governed by single DHPR openings. They also provide evidence for the assumption that RyR activation requires binding of multiple Ca2+ ions in accordance with the tetrameric organization of the channel protein.}",

abstract = {Activation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) by elevating cytosolic Ca2+ is a central step in the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, but the molecular basis of RyR2 activation by cytosolic Ca2+ is poorly defined. It has been proposed recently that the putative Ca2+ binding domain encompassing a pair of EF-hand motifs (EF1 and EF2) in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) functions as a Ca2+ sensor that regulates the gating of RyR1. Although the role of the EF-hand domain in RyR1 function has been studied extensively, little is known about the functional significance of the corresponding EF-hand domain in RyR2. Here we investigate the effect of mutations in the EF-hand motifs on the Ca2+ activation of RyR2. We found that mutations in the EF-hand motifs or deletion of the entire EF-hand domain did not affect the Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding or the cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2. On the other hand, deletion of the EF-hand domain markedly suppressed the luminal Ca2+ activation of RyR2 and spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells during store Ca2+ overload or store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). Furthermore, mutations in the EF2 motif, but not EF1 motif, of RyR2 raised the threshold for SOICR termination, whereas deletion of the EF-hand domain of RyR2 increased both the activation and termination thresholds for SOICR. These results indicate that, although the EF-hand domain is not required for RyR2 activation by cytosolic Ca2+, it plays an important role in luminal Ca2+ activation and SOICR.}

The studies reveal that for both skeletal and cardiac RyRs, heterogeneous populations of channels exist, rather than a uniform behavior. Skeletal muscle RyRs displayed two extremes of behavior: 1) low-activity RyRs (LA skeletal RyRs, approximately 35 percent of the channels) had very low open probability (Po < 0.1) at all [Ca2+] and remained closed in the presence of Mg2+ (2 mM) and ATP (1 mM); 2) high-activity RyRs (HA skeletal RyRs) had much higher activity and displayed further heterogeneity in their Po values at low [Ca2+] (< 50 nM), and in their patterns of activation by [Ca2+]. Hill coefficients for activation (nHa) varied from 0.8 to 5.2. Cardiac RyRs, in comparison, behaved more homogeneously. Most cardiac RyRs were closed at 100 nM [Ca2+] and activated in a cooperative manner (nHa ranged from 1.6 to 5.0), reaching a high Po (> 0.6) in the presence and absence of Mg2+ and ATP. Heart RyRs were much less sensitive (10x) to inhibition by [Ca2+] than skeletal RyRs.

A large fraction (65) of NP-EGTA, which has a negligible Mg2+ affinity, uncages with a time constant of 10.3ms, resulting in relatively slow increases in [Ca2+]. Uncaging of DMn is considerably faster, but DMn has a significant affinity for Mg2+ to complicate the uncaging process. With experimentally determined values for the Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding/unbinding rates of DMn and NP-EGTA, we built a mathematical model to assess the utility of NP-EGTA and DMn in rapid Ca2+-uncaging experiments in the presence of Mg2+. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using each compound under different conditions. To determine the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to biologically relevant Ca2+ buffers, such as Ca2+-binding proteins, the use of DMn is preferable even in the presence of Mg2+.}

                  prepared from diaphragm muscle, which contains both

                  functionally distinct ryanodine receptor calcium

                  properties typical of RyR1 channels, a second
                  population of ryanodine‐sensitive channels with
                  properties distinct from those of RyR1 channels was
                  observed. The novel channels displayed close‐to‐zero
                  open‐probability at nanomolar Ca2+ concentrations in
                  the presence of 1 mM ATP, but were shifted to the
                  open conformation by increasing Ca2+ to micromolar
                  levels and were not inhibited at higher Ca2+
                  concentrations. These novel channels were sensitive
                  to the stimulatory effects of cyclic adenosine
                  5′‐diphosphoribose (cADPR). Detection of this second
                  population of RyR channels in lipid bilayers was
                  always associated with the presence of the RyR3
                  isoform in muscle preparations used for
                  single‐channel measurements and was abrogated by the
                  knockout of the RyR3 gene in mice. Based on the
                  above, we associated the novel population of
                  channels with the RyR3 isoform of Ca2+ release
                  channels. The functional properties of the RyR3
                  channels are in agreement with a potential

abstract = {To investigate the channel properties of the mammalian type 3 ryanodine receptor (RyR3), we have cloned the RyR3 cDNA from rabbit uterus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and expressed the cDNA in HEK293 cells. Immunoblotting studies showed that the cloned RyR3 was indistinguishable from the native mammalian RyR3 in molecular size and immunoreactivity. Ca2+ release measurements using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator fluo 3 revealed that the cloned RyR3 functioned as a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release channel in HEK293 cells. Functional properties of the cloned RyR3 were further characterized by using single channel recordings in lipid bilayers. The cloned RyR3 channel exhibited a K+conductance of 777 picosiemens in 250 mm KCl and a Ca2+ conductance of 137 picosiemens in 250 mmCaCl2 and displayed apCa2+/pK+ ratio of 6.3 and an open time constant of about 1.16 ms. The response of the cloned RyR3 to cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations was biphasic. The channel was activated by Ca2+ at about 100 nmand inactivated at about 10 mm. Ca2+ alone was able to activate the cloned RyR3 fully. Calmodulin activated the cloned RyR3 at low Ca2+ concentrations but inhibited the channel at high Ca2+ concentrations. The cloned RyR3 was activated by ATP, caffeine, and perchlorate, inhibited by Mg2+ and ruthenium red, and modified by ryanodine. Cyclic ADP-ribose did not seem to affect single channel activity of the cloned RyR3. The most prominent differences of the cloned RyR3 from the rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor were in the gating kinetics, extent of maximal activation by Ca2+, and sensitivity to Ca2+ inactivation. Results of the present study provide initial insights into the single channel properties of the mammalian RyR3.}

abstract = {The functional effects of calmodulin (CaM) on single cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors) (RyR2s) were determined in the presence of two endogenous channel effectors, MgATP and reduced glutathione, using the planar lipid bilayer method. Single-channel activities, number of events, and open and close times were determined at varying cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. CaM reduced channel open probability at <10μM Ca2+ by decreasing channel events and mean open times and increasing mean close times. At >10μM Ca2+, CaM was less effective in inhibiting RyR2. CaM decreased mean open times but increased channel events, without significantly affecting mean close times. A series of voltage pulses was applied to the bilayer from +50 to −50mV and from −50mV to +50mV to rapidly increase and decrease open channel-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum lumenal to cytosolic Ca2+ fluxes. CaM decreased the duration of the open events after the voltage switch from −50mV to +50mV. In parallel experiments, a Ca2+-insensitive calmodulin mutant was without effect on RyR2 activity. The results are discussed in terms of a possible role of CaM in the termination of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release.}

    abstract = "{ Stochastic simulation of cell signaling pathways and genetic regulatory networks has contributed to the understanding of cell function; however, investigation of larger, more complicated systems requires computationally efficient algorithms. τ-leaping methods, which improve efficiency when some molecules have high copy numbers, either use a fixed leap size, which does not adapt to changing state, or recalculate leap size at a heavy computational cost. We present a hybrid simulation method for reaction-diffusion systems which combines exact stochastic simulation and τ-leaping in a dynamic way. Putative times of events are stored in a priority queue, which reduces the cost of each step of the simulation. For every reaction and diffusion channel at each step of the simulation the more efficient of an exact stochastic event or a τ-leap is chosen. This new approach removes the inherent trade-off between speed and accuracy in stiff systems which was present in all τ-leaping methods by allowing each reaction channel to proceed at its own pace. Both directions of reversible reactions and diffusion are combined in a single event, allowing bigger leaps to be taken. This improves efficiency for systems near equilibrium where forward and backward events are approximately equally frequent. Comparison with existing algorithms and behaviour for five test cases of varying complexity shows that the new method is almost as accurate as exact stochastic simulation, scales well for large systems, and for various problems can be significantly faster than τ-leaping. }",
