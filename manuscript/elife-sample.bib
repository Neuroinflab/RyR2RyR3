    abstract = "{The Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) regulates cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)-mediated Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. CaM inhibits RyR2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and aberrant CaM-dependent inhibition results in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. However, the molecular details of the CaM–RyR2 interaction remain unclear. Four CaM-binding domains (CaMBD1a, -1b, -2, and -3) in RyR2 have been proposed. Here, we investigated the Ca2+-dependent interactions between CaM and these CaMBDs by monitoring changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled CaMBD peptides during titration with CaM at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. We showed that CaM bound to all four CaMBDs with affinities that increased with Ca2+ concentration. CaM bound to CaMBD2 and -3 with high affinities across all Ca2+ concentrations tested, but bound to CaMBD1a and -1b only at Ca2+ concentrations above 0.2 µM. Binding experiments using individual CaM domains revealed that the CaM C-domain preferentially bound to CaMBD2, and the N-domain to CaMBD3. Moreover, the Ca2+ affinity of the CaM C-domain in complex with CaMBD2 or -3 was so high that these complexes are essentially Ca2+ saturated under resting Ca2+ conditions. Conversely, the N-domain senses Ca2+ exactly in the transition from resting to activating Ca2+ when complexed to either CaMBD2 or -3. Altogether, our results support a binding model where the CaM C-domain is anchored to RyR2 CaMBD2 and saturated with Ca2+ during Ca2+ oscillations, while the CaM N-domain functions as a dynamic Ca2+ sensor that can bridge noncontiguous regions of RyR2 or clamp down onto CaMBD2.}",

While much of CaM is thought to be protein bound, quantitative data in cardiac myocytes is lacking regarding CaM location, [CaM]free and CaM redistribution during changes in [Ca2+]i. Here, we demonstrated that in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes, CaM is highly concentrated at Z-lines (confirmed by Di-8-ANEPPS staining of transverse tubules) using three different approaches: immunocytochemistry (endogenous CaM), Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate CaM (F-CaM) in both permeabilized cells (exogenous CaM) and in patch clamped intact cells (via pipette dialysis). Using 100nM [CaM]free we washed F-CaM into permeabilized myocytes and saw a two-phase (fast and slow) CaM binding curve with a plateau after 40min of F-CaM wash-in. We also measured myocyte [CaM]free using two modified null-point titration methods, finding [CaM]free to be 50–75nM (which is only 1/100 of total [CaM]). Higher [Ca2+]i increased CaM binding especially in the nucleus and at Z-lines and significantly slowed F-CaM dissociation rate when F-CaM was washed out of permeabilized myocytes. Additionally, in both permeabilized and intact myocytes, CaM moved into the nucleus when [Ca2+]i was elevated, and this was reversible. We conclude that [CaM]free is very low in myocytes even at resting [Ca2+]i, indicating intense competition of CaM targets for free CaM. Bound CaM is relatively concentrated at Z-lines at rest but translocates significantly to the nucleus upon elevation of [Ca2+]i, which may influence activation of different targets and cellular functions.}

@Comment  SOICR in WT RyR2-expressing HEK-293 cells displayed an activation threshold of 93±0.5% store capacity and a termination threshold of 58±0.7% store capacity. Interestingly, a termination threshold of ~60% was observed in cardiomyocytes, also Ca binding to the C-lobe of RyR bound CaM (at CaMBD2) reduces the threshold of SOICR termination to 40%

    abstract = "{RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine receptor)-mediated Ca2+ release in cardiomyocytes terminates when the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content depletes to a threshold level, known as the termination threshold. Despite its importance, little is known about the mechanism that regulates the termination threshold. CaM (calmodulin), by inhibiting RyR2, has been implicated in Ca2+-release termination, but whether CaM modulates the termination threshold is unknown. To this end, we monitored the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ dynamics in RyR2-expressing HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells transfected with WT (wild-type) CaM or mutants. We found that WT CaM or CaM mutations which abolish Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe (N-terminal lobe) of CaM increased the termination threshold (i.e. facilitated termination), but had no effect on the activation threshold at which spontaneous Ca2+ release occurs. On the other hand, CaM mutations that diminish Ca2+ binding to both the N-lobe and C-lobe (C-terminal lobe), or the C-lobe only, decreased the termination threshold (i.e. delayed termination) with a similar activation threshold. Furthermore, deletion of residues 3583–3603 or point mutations (W3587A/L3591D/F3603A, W3587A, or L3591D) in the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 that are known to abolish or retain CaM binding all reduced the termination threshold without having a significant impact on the activation threshold. Interestingly, the RyR2-F3603A mutation affected both the activation and termination threshold. Collectively, these data indicate that CaM facilitates the termination of Ca2+ release by increasing the termination threshold, and that this action of CaM depends on Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe, but not to the N-lobe, of CaM. The results of the present study also suggest that the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 is an important determinant of Ca2+-release termination and activation.}",

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein that regulates the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) by direct binding. CaM inhibits the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and cardiac muscle receptor (RyR2) at >1 μm Ca2+ but activates RyR1 and inhibits RyR2 at <1 μm Ca2+. Here we tested whether CaM regulates RyR2 by binding to a highly conserved site identified previously in RyR1. Deletion of RyR2 amino acid residues 3583–3603 resulted in background [35S]CaM binding levels. In single channel measurements, deletion of the putative CaM binding site eliminated CaM inhibition of RyR2 at Ca2+ concentrations below and above 1 μm. Five RyR2 single or double mutants in the CaM binding region (W3587A, L3591D, F3603A, W3587A/L3591D, L3591D/F3603A) eliminated or greatly reduced [35S]CaM binding and inhibition of single channel activities by CaM depending on the Ca2+ concentration. An RyR2 mutant, which assessed the effects of 4 amino acid residues that differ between RyR1 and RyR2 in or flanking the CaM binding domain, bound [35S]CaM and was inhibited by CaM, essentially identical to wild type (WT)-RyR2. Three RyR1 mutants (W3620A, L3624D, F3636A) showed responses to CaM that differed from corresponding mutations in RyR2. The results indicate that CaM regulates RyR1 and RyR2 by binding to a single, highly conserved CaM binding site and that other RyR type-specific sites are likely responsible for the differential functional regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM.}

abstract = {A number of calmodulin (CaM) mutations cause severe cardiac arrhythmias, but their arrhythmogenic mechanisms are unclear. While some of the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations have been shown to impair CaM-dependent inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release through the ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2), the impact of a majority of these mutations on RyR2 function is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of 14 arrhythmogenic CaM mutations on the CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition. We found that all the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations tested diminished CaM-dependent inhibition of RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release and increased store-overload induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) in HEK293 cells. Moreover, all the arrhythmogenic CaM mutations tested either failed to inhibit or even promoted RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release in permeabilized HEK293 cells with elevated cytosolic Ca2+, which was markedly different from the inhibitory action of CaM wild-type. The CaM mutations also altered the Ca2+-dependency of CaM binding to the RyR2 CaM-binding domain. These results demonstrate that diminished inhibition, and even facilitated activation, of RyR2–mediated Ca2+ release is a common defect of arrhythmogenic CaM mutations.},
